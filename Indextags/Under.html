      <h2>"Under" the water</h2>
      <p>
      A journey through the icy waters of the North Sea Half-sunken into the icy waters of Lindesnes, Under invites you to dine five meters below the surface. The panoramic view of the seabed offers a visual gateway to the sea and connects the guests to the wildlife outside. This provides you with an opportunity to take in the otherwise rarely seen marine ecosystem of the North Atlantic Ocean.
      </p>
      <p>In collaboration with Snøhetta and several experienced local partners, we have developed a restaurant with an equal focus on marine research, architecture and gastronomy.
        By focusing on the coexistence of life on land and in the sea, Under proposes a new way of understanding our relationship to our surroundings – above the surface, under the water, and alongside the life of the sea.
        With this as a backdrop you will gain a better understanding of the food you eat.</p>
      <p>Under has been designed with sensitive consideration for its geographic context and aquatic neighbors. In time, the structure will become a part of its marine environment, as the roughness of the concrete shell will work as an artificial reef, welcoming limpets and kelp to inhabit it.
        With the thick concrete walls lying against the craggy shoreline, the structure is built to withstand pressure and shock from the rugged sea conditions. Like a sunken periscope, the restaurant’s massive acrylic windows offer a view of the seabed as it changes throughout the seasons and varying weather conditions.

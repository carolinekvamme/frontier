      <p id="para">In collaboration with our partners TOI group we have developed a modern house Modern House, with a swimming pool for a big family in the village Novoaleksandrivka in the Dnepropetrovsk region.
        The house has a free lay-out with a beautiful double-light space, connecting the living room and the second floor, with three bedrooms, bathrooms and a wardrobe. On the first floor there is a spacious entrance hall, a bathroom, a laundry room, a cabinet, a living room and a kitchen with a dining room, from which there is an exit to the pool area.
        Minimalistic modern lines of the house are mitigated by the warmth of natural materials in the finish â€“ stone, wood and textured gray plaster.
        The terrece with barbecue area is made of a wooden bar, painted in black.
        The house is located on a plot with active relief and a beautiful view of the ravine from the rear facade and on this side of the house there are large panoramic windows, and the terrace with the pool has been raised to the floor level of the house.

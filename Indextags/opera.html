      <h2>The opera in Norway</h2>
      <p> The operahouse is the realisation of the winning competion entry. Four diagrams, which were part of the entry, explain the building's basic concept.
          "The wave wall"
          Opera and ballet are young artforms in Norway. These artforms evolve in an international setting . The Bjørvika peninsula is part of a harbour city, which is historically the meeting point with the rest of the world.. The dividing line between the ground 'here' and the water ‘there'is both a real and a symbolic threshold. This threshold is realised as a large wall on the line of the meeting between land and sea, Norway and the world, art and everyday life. This is the threshold where the public meet the art.

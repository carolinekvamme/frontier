            <p> The icebreakers form an essential part of Katajanokka cityscape. The floating headquarters of Arctia Shipping crew will be situated next to the icebreakers beside Merikasarmi pier. The horizontal character of the building and the black metal façade compare elegantly with the image of the icebreaker ships. The floating headquarters relates to the icebreakers but is smaller in scale than the ships. The interior of the metallic "ship" is covered with warm lacquered wood. The façades of   the building are made of specially profiled steel, which is perforated and stamped with abstract ice crystal-like patterns.

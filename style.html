          <h4>USE COLOR IN HALLWAYS</h4>

          <h4>TRY FLOOR-TO-CEILING SHELVING</h4>
          <p>Floor-to-ceiling shelving never fails to add character to a room. In his Los Angeles home, acclaimed chef Ludovic "Ludo" Lefebvre opted for this shelving style for his collection of more than 1,000 cookbooks.</p>

          <h4>LOOK AT THE BIGGER PICTURE</h4>
          <p>Looking at your home from a holistic perspective—seeing how each room works in balance against the others—can help craft a welcome variety in your spaces, like this emerald and charcoal dining room that adds a touch of formality to an otherwise contemporary Los Angeles home.</p>
